    The SuggestLibrary plugin is a tool that suggests useful
    libraries to users based on their project's dependencies.
    It analyzes the user's pom.xml file and sends it to a
    recommendation API, which returns a list of recommended
    libraries. The plugin adds a "Suggest Libraries" button
    to the main menu bar of IntelliJ IDEA, allowing users to
    quickly explore and select the libraries that best fit
    their needs.

    With SuggestLibrary, you can save time and effort
    by automating the process of finding and selecting
    libraries for your project. Whether you're a beginner
    or an experienced developer, SuggestLibrary can help
    you discover new and relevant libraries that can
    improve your project's functionality and performance.

    Note: Some recommended libraries may not be compatible
    with your project. Please use caution when selecting
    and integrating new libraries.
